# STRICT EXPLANATION TEMPLATE

## Purpose
This template enforces the non-negotiable standard for all explanations.
Use this for NEW explanations. Use this to AUDIT existing ones.

---

## Template Structure

### 1. what_happened (2-4 sentences)

**Rule:** Factual, specific, no analysis.

**Required elements:**
- Who did what?
- When?
- What are the concrete facts?
- Include numbers/names/dates

**Bad:**
```
"Fed maintains rates at 4.0–4.25%; inflation data watched"
```

**Good:**
```
"The Federal Reserve held the benchmark interest rate at 4.0–4.25% in
its December 2025 meeting. The decision came with explicit discussion
of short-term funding market vulnerabilities. Specifically, Fed minutes
noted that overnight repo rates (the overnight borrowing market banks use)
spiked unexpectedly in late 2025, and some banks faced difficulties
accessing short-term cash around quarter-end."
```

---

### 2. why_it_happened (2-5 sentences) ⭐ CRITICAL

**Rule:** Explain the CAUSAL CHAIN. Answer "Why did this occur instead of something else?"

**Required elements:**
- What pressures/incentives led to this?
- What changed recently that triggered this?
- What's the historical context?
- If multiple causes: list them clearly
- Include confounding factors

**Bad:**
```
"The Fed kept rates steady because inflation remains above its 2% target."
```
- This is obvious. It's in the headline.

**Good:**
```
"The Fed kept rates steady because inflation, while cooling, remains above
its 2% target. But there's a deeper reason: December's FOMC minutes reveal
that Fed officials are now equally concerned about liquidity (how easy it is
to get cash) in short-term funding markets.

This shift happened because of stress episodes in late 2025. When banks
needed to roll over short-term loans around quarter-end, borrowing rates
spiked unexpectedly, and some banks had trouble accessing cash. Fed
officials see this as a warning sign. They remember 2024, when liquidity
tightened unexpectedly and forced emergency intervention.

So the Fed faces a dilemma: inflation is still a problem, but financial
system stress is also a problem. They chose to hold rates steady, signaling
they're worried about both."
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Explains causal chain (not just restatement)
- [ ] Includes historical context ("remember when...")
- [ ] Shows competing priorities if they exist
- [ ] Helps reader understand WHY this decision, not another one
- [ ] Non-finance reader could explain this to a friend

---

### 3. why_it_matters_now (3-6 sentences)

**Rule:** Show SECOND-ORDER EFFECTS. What changes in the world?

**NOT allowed:**
- "Important for investors"
- "Relevant for markets"
- "Could affect prices"

**Required elements:**
- What risk or opportunity changed?
- How does this affect decision-making?
- What becomes more/less likely?
- What should people be watching for?
- Be specific, not abstract

**Bad:**
```
"Fed officials were focused less on rate moves and more on whether
the financial system has enough cash to avoid sudden disruptions."
```
- This is just describing what the Fed cares about
- Doesn't explain what CHANGES for the reader

**Good:**
```
"Here's what changed: The Fed's attention shifted from 'Is inflation
overheating the economy?' to 'Do we have a liquidity crisis?'

This matters because the Fed acts differently depending on what they're
worried about. If they're worried about inflation, they ignore positive
economic news. If they're worried about liquidity, they act FAST on any
sign of stress—even if inflation is still a problem.

For your portfolio, this creates a new source of volatility. Markets might
spike down 3-5% on ANY funding news (repo rate spike, bank earnings mention
of cash problems, corporate liquidity warnings). It's unpredictable because
it's not about earnings or growth—it's about whether the financial plumbing
works.

The good news: The Fed will cut rates or inject cash FAST if liquidity
gets worse. The bad news: It could happen suddenly on a Tuesday afternoon,
regardless of what else is happening in markets."
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Explains what CHANGED in the world
- [ ] Shows second-order effects (not just "interesting")
- [ ] Answers "So what?" for a Mom
- [ ] Identifies new risks OR new opportunities
- [ ] Includes both upside and downside
- [ ] Non-finance reader understands how it affects them

---

### 4. who_this_applies_to (2-4 sentences)

**Rule:** Be EXPLICIT. Mom should know if it applies to her.

**NOT allowed:**
- "All market participants"
- "Relevant to portfolio construction"
- "Anyone with investments"

**Required elements:**
- List SPECIFIC people:
  - "If you own Apple stock..."
  - "If you have a 401(k) in tech index funds..."
  - "If you have a mortgage..."
- List who it does NOT apply to
- Use real fund names (QQQ, VTI, etc)

**Bad:**
```
"All market participants. Relevant to portfolio construction and risk management."
```

**Good:**
```
"This matters if you:
- Own Apple stock directly
- Have a 401(k) or IRA with a tech index fund (like QQQ, VGT, or XLK)
- Bank with a large U.S. bank (JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup)
- Have a mortgage (your bank depends on short-term funding)

This does NOT matter much if you:
- Only own bonds
- Only own gold or commodities
- Have cash in a savings account (FDIC-insured, so you're protected)
- Own only international stocks"
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Lists specific stocks or funds
- [ ] Includes real ticker symbols (QQQ, VTI, etc)
- [ ] Includes negatives (does NOT apply if...)
- [ ] A Mom could read this and know: "That's me" or "That's not me"
- [ ] Not generic hand-waving

---

### 5. what_to_watch_next (3-6 SPECIFIC signals) ⭐ CRITICAL

**Rule:** EXACTLY this format:

```
"Watch for X (published WHERE, HOW OFTEN) because it will indicate Y.

- If X happens, it means Z (positive/negative implication)
- If X doesn't happen, it means W (alternative implication)"
```

**Required elements for EACH signal:**
- What to watch (X)
- Where to find it (website, publication, frequency)
- What it means if it appears (Y)
- What it means if it doesn't appear (W)
- Threshold if numeric ("exceeds $500B", "below 3.5%", etc)

**Bad:**
```
"Monitor for follow-up developments and market reaction.
Watch for official statements and analyst commentary."
```
- No specific signals
- No where to find it
- No meaning
- FAILS the standard

**Good:**
```
"1) LIQUIDITY STRESS INDICATOR
Watch the Federal Reserve Bank of New York website daily.
Look for 'Secured Overnight Financing Rate' (SOFR).

- If SOFR stays above 6% for more than 2 consecutive days,
  it signals liquidity is actually tightening (the Fed's concern is real).

- If SOFR stays below 5.5%, it signals banks have plenty of cash
  (no crisis yet).

2) FED EMERGENCY ACTION SIGNAL
Listen to Powell's next public statement (expected late January).

- If he mentions 'liquidity stabilizing' or 'stress easing',
  it means the Fed thinks the problem is contained (lower risk).

- If he mentions 'remaining fragile' or 'still monitoring closely',
  it means trouble could continue (higher risk).

3) CORPORATE STRESS SIGNAL
During January-February earnings calls, listen for management mentioning:
- 'Funding costs increased'
- 'Cash management challenges'
- 'Difficult refinancing environment'

- If multiple companies mention this, it signals stress is widespread
  (more volatility likely).

- If none mention it, it signals stress is contained to specific markets
  (lower risk)."
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Each signal has: X, WHERE, HOW OFTEN
- [ ] Each signal has: "if X, then Y" (meaning)
- [ ] Each signal has: "if NOT X, then W" (alternative)
- [ ] Includes numeric thresholds if relevant
- [ ] Non-finance reader can actually DO this
- [ ] Reader doesn't need to Google to find the data
- [ ] No vague language ("monitor", "watch for developments")

---

### 6. what_this_does_not_mean (2-4 statements) ⭐ CRITICAL

**Rule:** PREVENT misconceptions. Close emotional loops.

**Required elements:**
- Counteract 2-3 likely fear/hype conclusions
- Be explicit: "This does NOT mean..."
- Include both overly-pessimistic and overly-optimistic misreadings

**Bad:**
```
"This is informational only and does not constitute investment advice."
```
- This is legal boilerplate, not helpful

**Good:**
```
"This does NOT mean:
- The Fed is preparing an emergency rate cut (they're monitoring, not panicking)
- A financial crisis is coming (funding stress happens quarterly; it's normal)
- You should sell everything (liquidity stress is different from a crash)
- Inflation is no longer a concern (the Fed still cares, it's just not the focus)

What this DOES mean:
- Volatility will spike on funding news, not economic news
- The Fed will act faster than usual if stress worsens
- Bank stocks could fall if their funding costs rise"
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Counters at least 2 fear conclusions
- [ ] Counters at least 1 hype conclusion
- [ ] Explicit: "This does NOT mean..."
- [ ] Includes "what this DOES mean" reframing
- [ ] Helps reader avoid panic or complacency

### 9. cause_confidence (High / Medium / Low)

**Rule:** Justified by cause_reason.

**High:** Based on official statements, documented facts, clear causal chain
**Medium:** Based on reasonable inference, but some uncertainty
**Low:** Speculative, multiple possible interpretations

---

### 10. cause_reason (1-2 sentences)

**Rule:** Explain WHY confidence is at this level.

**Bad:**
```
"The Fed's statements are clear."
```

**Good:**
```
"FOMC minutes are official documents published by the Federal Reserve.
The liquidity stress events are documented in news reports and banking
data. The shift in Fed language is explicit in recent speeches. These
are not interpretations—they are facts."
```

---

### 11. decision_reasoning

```json
{
  "accepted_because": [
    "Explains causal chain, not just headline",
    "Shows second-order effects",
    "Provides concrete watch signals with WHERE and MEANING",
    "Closes misconceptions explicitly",
    "Non-finance reader achieves closure"
  ],
  "rejected_if_applicable": []
}
```

---

### 12. plain_summary (Optional, but preferred)

**Rule:** 1 sentence, for iOS headline preview.

## Example: Complete Explanation Following Strict Template

```
GROUP: December FOMC minutes show the Fed is worried short-term funding could seize up

what_happened:
The Federal Reserve held the benchmark interest rate at 4.0–4.25% in its
December 2025 meeting. The decision came with explicit discussion of short-term
funding market vulnerabilities. Specifically, Fed minutes noted that overnight
repo rates (the overnight borrowing market banks use to access short-term cash)
spiked unexpectedly in late 2025, and some banks faced difficulties accessing
cash around quarter-end.

why_it_happened:
The Fed kept rates steady because inflation, while cooling, remains above its 2%
target. But there's a deeper reason: Fed officials are now equally concerned
about liquidity in short-term funding markets. This shift happened because of
stress episodes in late 2025. When banks needed to roll over short-term loans
around quarter-end, borrowing rates spiked unexpectedly, and some banks had
trouble accessing cash. Fed officials see this as a warning. They remember 2024,
when liquidity tightened unexpectedly, forcing emergency intervention. So the
Fed faces a dilemma: inflation is still a problem, but funding stress is also
a problem.

why_it_matters_now:
Here's what changed: The Fed's attention shifted from "Is inflation overheating
the economy?" to "Do we have a liquidity crisis?" This matters because the Fed
acts differently depending on what they're worried about. If worried about
inflation, they ignore positive economic news. If worried about liquidity, they
act FAST on any sign of stress. For your portfolio, this creates a new source
of volatility: markets might spike down 3-5% on funding news, regardless of
economic data. The good news: the Fed will cut rates or inject cash FAST if
liquidity worsens. The bad news: it could happen suddenly.

who_this_applies_to:
This matters if you own stocks, have a bank account, or have a mortgage. It does
NOT matter much if you only hold U.S. Treasury bonds or own only gold.

what_to_watch_next:
1) LIQUIDITY STRESS INDICATOR
Watch the Federal Reserve Bank of New York website daily for SOFR (Secured
Overnight Financing Rate).
- If SOFR exceeds 6% for 2+ consecutive days, it signals liquidity is actually
  tightening (the Fed's concern is real).
- If SOFR stays below 5.5%, banks have plenty of cash (no crisis yet).

2) FED EMERGENCY ACTION SIGNAL
Listen to Powell's next statement (expected late January).
- If he says "stabilizing" or "easing," it means the Fed thinks the problem is
  contained (lower risk).
- If he says "fragile" or "monitoring closely," trouble could continue (higher
  risk).

3) CORPORATE STRESS SIGNAL
During January-February earnings calls, count mentions of "funding costs,"
"cash management challenges," or "refinancing difficulties."
- If multiple companies mention this, stress is widespread (higher volatility).
- If none mention it, stress is contained (lower risk).

what_this_does_not_mean:
This does NOT mean: The Fed will cut rates immediately (they're monitoring, not
panicking). A financial crisis is coming (funding stress is quarterly and normal).
You should sell everything (liquidity stress is different from a crash). Inflation
is no longer a concern (the Fed still cares, it's not the focus).

sources_summary:
- Federal Reserve (FOMC minutes, December 2025)
- Federal Reserve Bank of New York (repo rate data)

cause_confidence: High

cause_reason:
FOMC minutes are official documents. Liquidity stress events are documented in
banking data and news reports. The shift in Fed language is explicit in recent
speeches. These are facts, not interpretations.

decision_reasoning:
{
  "accepted_because": [
    "Explains WHY the Fed shifted priorities (liquidity stress in late 2025)",
    "Shows second-order effect (volatility on funding news, not economic news)",
    "Provides 3 concrete watch signals with WHERE and MEANING",
    "Closes misconceptions (not an immediate rate cut, not a crisis necessarily)",
    "Non-finance reader achieves closure and can watch for signals"
  ]
}

plain_summary:
The Fed shifted from worrying about inflation to worrying about bank funding,
which could trigger sudden market swings on funding news.

  if (explanation.why_it_matters_now.length < 300) {
    issues.push('why_it_matters_now: Too short (should show second-order effects)');
  }

  if (explanation.who_this_applies_to.includes('all market participants')) {
    issues.push('who_this_applies_to: Too generic (be specific)');
  }

  // Check signals
  const signals = explanation.what_to_watch_next.split('\n').length;
  if (signals < 3) {
    issues.push('what_to_watch_next: Fewer than 3 concrete signals');
